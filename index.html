	<div class="center story">
<p><strong>Hi</strong> my name is Ryan.  About 6 months ago I decided I wanted to learn web developement as a career.  I began at codeacademy.com, and once I completed the HTML/CSS/Javascript basics I started working on my own little practice projects, of which I have about 20.  I've been supplimenting my knowledge with lots of StackOverflow and Smashing magazine.  None of my little projects are suitable for a portfolio (mostly css wireframes and javascript animations), so I decided to make this page as an example of what I can do. I wanted to get it to you as fast as possible so its not perfect.  I provided a summation of skills used to make this page, and things I would do differently if I remade it, in the content slider below.</p>

<p>I come from a service background, coffee shop and kitchen jobs.  As a result I have a really good work ethic.  Everything must be done as quickly as possible and work doesn't stop till all tasks are completed.  I have no problem coding in 5-6 hour blocks and all deadlines will be met.</p>

<p>I noticed in your craigslist ad you mentioned LESS.  I don't anticpate a problem switching over from CSS to LESS.</p>

<p>I'd love the opportunity to further discuss what you're looking for and how I might fit in.  I'd be open to coding tests, or if you need to see more samples of my work I could create something to your specifications.  The best way to contact me is probably through email at Rhwelch2009@gmail.com.  You can also contact me in the evening by phone (text/call) at 518-649-0957.</p>

Thanks for your time
<p>-Ryan Welch</p>

			<p><h3>Q: Why didn't you just make this in bootstrap?</h3></p>
			<p>A: Yeah I could have done this in an hour using bootstrap and other people's jquery plugins, but I wanted to demonstrate I can hand code and I understand the elements of modern design.</p>
			<p><h3>Q: Is the cleanest code you can write?</h3></p>

		<div class="active click content4">
		To make this slider I made a container for the content.  I find positioning a div both vertically and horizontally center is easiest with jquery, so I wrote a couple lines to do that.  Next I made 4 content containers and had them hide offscreen to the right based on the width of the container.   When a button is clicked it takes the active class and slides it to the left, then once its off screen it instantly positions it off to the right, ready to be slid again.  The new active class slides in from the right.
		<p>After I made it I realized there are problems with class switching to control animations.  If you click on the buttons quickly the active class gets stuck.</p>

I don't really have anything to write in the footer.  Here you can go back up to the top:
