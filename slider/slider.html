			<p>A: Yeah I could have done this in 10 minutes using bootstrap and other people's jquery plugins, but I wanted to demonstrate I can hand code and I understand the elements of modern design.</p>

							<ohSnap2>
					<li>I would write all the javascript functions to be reusable</li>
					<li>More semantic tags</li>
					<li>I'd probably include some animated charts here.</li>

					<li>Make my email address clickable and linked to something.</li>
					<li>CSS animation instead of jquery.</li>
					<li>Alot more work with media queries, landscape mode in particular.</li>
					<li>Slider needs to be totally rewritten to be simpler and queue properly.</li>	</ohSnap2>

		To make this slider I made a container for the content.  I find positioning a div both vertically and horizontally center is easiest with jquery, so I wrote a couple lines to do that.  Next I made 4 content containers and had them hide offscreen to the right based on the width of the container.   When a button is clicked it takes the active class and slides it to the left, then once its off screen it instantly positions it off to the right, ready to be slid again.  The new active class slides in from the right.
		<p>After I made it I realized there are problems with class switching to control animations. <span style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through;"> If you click on the buttons quickly the active class gets stuck.</span> <span style="color:red">FIXED</span></p>
